      <h1>My Thoughts on the Web</h1> 
      <p>For as long as I can remember, the internet has been around. From the sound of a modem spinning up to the certain argument when someone wanted to use the phone, I've always felt emotionally connected to computers. I still feel the satisfaction of seeing how quickly Google returns search results. </p>
      <p>In high school, I had my first experience learning how to develop for the web. We learned basic html and designed with tables. The frustration of making a table look right still haunts me. Sadly, I let this frustration discourage me from seriously pursuing web development. Cue Dreamweaver. When I discovered the value of having a powerful IDE in my toolbelt, it changed my perception of programming. 
      <p>Included as a part of the Adobe toolset was Flash. The entertainment aspect of creating animations heavily distracted me from most things, especially schoolwork, and a large majority of my time was spent on Newgrounds, ebaums world, and other like sites. </p>
